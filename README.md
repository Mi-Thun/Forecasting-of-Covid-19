 #### Part C and Part C (cont.)
 Regarding the COVID Dataset
-----------------------------
The dataset has been collected from the Directorate General of Health Services, Bangladesh.
The dataset has 626 rows and 4 columns.
The dataset contains the number of COVID tests performed, number of persons tested positive 
and number of death cases for each day.

#### Term Project
--------------------------------------------
As a term project, you will build Regression (SKIP dataset which requires Classification Models).

For Regression model, you must implement the following algorithms.
1. Linear Regression
2. Polynomial Regression 
3. Lasso Regression
4. Ridge Regression
5. Elasticnet Regression

You have to also compare their performances through appropriate evaluation metrics using your own module. 
  
At the end, you need to write a report based on the given template and need to present your work (15 minutes presentation). During the presentation, your cam must be switched on and each member in a group must participate in the presentation. Not participating/attending presentation would incur serious penalty.

-------------------------------------------------------
1. Write a Python script that can compute the inverse of a 3*3 square matrix. You must not use any library functions.

2. Write a Python script that implements your Linear Regression Model for a  multivariate linear regression problem. Use concepts of Linear Algebra to accomplish that. You must use your own built functions and modules and must not use any library functions except it is extremely required. You must show appropriate plotting. You must show the train accuracy and loss values using own module along with appropriate plots. Do same for test loss and accuracy. Use RealEstate csv dataset to solve the problem.

Note: You must write code as data science perspective. Do not implement numerical or statistical approaches. You are allowed to use sklearn train test split method only.

However, for all models you can use sklearn at the end of the project to show comparison between your developped module and existing module.
